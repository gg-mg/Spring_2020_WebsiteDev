                <h2> Government support is vital for farmers success</h2>
                <p>The Kenyan government does not have any good policies in place to help her farmers.
                    The government actions seem to hurt the farmers more than help them. I have provided two links below
                    as reported by a leading newspaper in Kenya. In the first article,
                    <a href="https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Munya-we-will-import-4-million-bags-of-white--yellow-maize/1056-5510388-4qegi0z/index.html"
                        target="_blank">the government of Kenya ordered importation of 4 million bags of maize.</a> This took in place
                    in early April 2020. By the time i was writing this article, in May 2020, the farmers were trying to use the law
                    courts to
                    <a href="https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Farmers-advise-government-against-maize-imports/1056-5508416-p77m6wz/index.html"
                        target="_blank">seek redress</a>
                    because they had maize stocks which the government had not exhausted before ordering importation.
                    It is worth noting that the minister of agriculture addresses the issue of fertilizer in the first article
                    because the farmers have no access to affordable fertilizer and are at the mercy of middlemen and brokers.
                </p>

                
                <h2>Land Distribution</h2>
                <p>Land distribution is one a major factor that contributes to poor farm output in Kenya. Majority of
                    the people own less than 5 acres of land which can only be suitable for subsitence farming, not
                    commercial farming. Only a very small percentage of arable land, less than 5%, is under commercial
                    farming use.</p>
                <h2>Poor farming techniques</h2>
                <p>Most farmers do not consult agricultural extension officers. This is because the scale of farming
                    does warrant such services. Most farmers depend on rain to grow crops which has become very
                    unpredictable due to global warming.
                </p>
                <h2>High level corruption</h2>
                <p>It is hard to do anything anywhere in the world, especially commercial farming without involving the
                    goverment. Transparency International, an international NGO which monitors corruption ranked Kenya
                    137/180 in
                    2019 compared to US which was ranked 12/180 in the same period. Corruption is a hinderance to
                    farming in Kenya
