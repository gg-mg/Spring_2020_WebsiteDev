    <h1>Government support is vital for farmers success</h1>
   
    <p>On 04/04/2020, the minister for agriculture in Kenya announced that the government would 
        import 4,000, 000 bags of maize to cover for the looming shortage of the country's staple food.
        The stocks in government hands are sufficient supplies one month, the minister continued.
        When asked by a journalist why the government cannot buy the locally produced maize that the 
        farmers have in their stores he reiterated the government's stand was to import rather than purchase 
        locally produced maize.
        The government policies in Kenya for support of farmers are nearly non-existent and where they exist, 
        the policies are oppressive to farmers. Why import maize when Kenyan farmers have millions of tonnes that
         they can sell to the government? This one of the government policies related problem Kenyan farmers face.
        Other problems that farmers face in Kenya face include lack of good storage facilities for the harvested 
        produce. The government rents to farmers storage silos but most farmers cannot afford the prices charged, 
       or do not produce volumes big enough to warrant the need to hire the government facilities. Lack of consistent
        supply of government-subsidized fertilizer is another big problem. Middlemen divert the fertilizers to secondary
          markets where the fertilizers are sold at exorbitant prices. The prices farmers are offered for their
           produce is not consummate to their work. Most of the time, prices offered cannot cover the cost of
            labor and farm inputs. Take for example maize prices. The ideal market price of a 90-kilogram bag 
            of maize is USD 35. In many instances, farmers are offered as low as USD 16 for a bag of the 
            90-kilogram bag. The government does not protect the farmers against the
        unscrupulous business people out to rip off the farmers.</p>
		<h2> Government support is vital for farmers success</h2>
<p>The Kenyan government does not have any policies in place to help her farmers. The farmers in Kenya are exploited by middlemen who buy 
    the produce from farmers at very poor prices. Another set of middlemen sell farm inputs like fertilizers and seeds to the farmers at high prices.
</p>
<p>Land distribution is one a major factor which contributes to poor farm output in Kenya. Majority of the people own less than 5 acres of land which 
    can only be suitable for subsitence farming, not commercial farming. Only a very percentage of arable land, less than 5% is under commercial 
    farming use. 
</p>
<p>Poor farming techniques.</p>
<p>High level corruption. The Isreali government invested millions of dollars in 2018 to irrigate 10,000 acres in a project at Galana/Kulalu, in
    the costal area of Kenya. The investors abandoned the project due to red tape from corrupt goverment ofiicials. The project would have produced enough 
    maize to bring down maize prices by 50%.
</p>

        <p>This is unlike in the US where the government actively protects its farmers. Farmers in the US are paid for crop failure by insurance companies. The government protects the farmers from unfair global competitions and 
        regulates production quotas by paying farmers not to grow crops.</p>

<h2>Poor farming techniques.</h2>
<p>Most farmers do not consult agricultural extension officers. This is because the scale of farming does warranty such services.
    Most farmers depend on rain to grow crops which has become very unpredictable due to global warming. </p>

<h2>High level corruption</h2>
<p>It is hard to do anything anywhere in the world, especially commercial farming without involving the goverment. 
    Transparency International, an international NGO which monitors corruption ranked Kenya 137/180 in 2019 compared to US
    which was ranked 12/180 in the same period. Corruption is a hinderance to farming in Kenya</p>
