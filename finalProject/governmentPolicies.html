    <h1>Government support is vital for farmers success</h1>
   
    <p>On 04/04/2020, the minister for agriculture in Kenya announced that the government would 
        import 4,000, 000 bags of maize to cover for the looming shortage of the country's staple food.
        The stocks in government hands are sufficient supplies one month, the minister continued.
        When asked by a journalist why the government cannot buy the locally produced maize that the 
        farmers have in their stores he reiterated the government's stand was to import rather than purchase 
        locally produced maize.
        The government policies in Kenya for support of farmers are nearly non-existent and where they exist, 
        the policies are oppressive to farmers. Why import maize when Kenyan farmers have millions of tonnes that
         they can sell to the government? This one of the government policies related problem Kenyan farmers face.
        Other problems that farmers face in Kenya face include lack of good storage facilities for the harvested 
        produce. The government rents to farmers storage silos but most farmers cannot afford the prices charged, 
       or do not produce volumes big enough to warrant the need to hire the government facilities. Lack of consistent
        supply of government-subsidized fertilizer is another big problem. Middlemen divert the fertilizers to secondary
          markets where the fertilizers are sold at exorbitant prices. The prices farmers are offered for their
           produce is not consummate to their work. Most of the time, prices offered cannot cover the cost of
            labor and farm inputs. Take for example maize prices. The ideal market price of a 90-kilogram bag 
            of maize is USD 35. In many instances, farmers are offered as low as USD 16 for a bag of the 
            90-kilogram bag. The government does not protect the farmers against the
        unscrupulous business people out to rip off the farmers.</p>

        <p>This is unlike in the US where the government actively protects its farmers. Farmers in the US are paid for crop failure by insurance companies. The government protects the farmers from unfair global competitions and 
        regulates production quotas by paying farmers not to grow crops.</p>
