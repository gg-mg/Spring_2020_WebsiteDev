    <h1>Agricultural economies</h1>
    <p>Both the US and Kenya are agricultural based econonies but for very different reasons.
        The US imports most of manufacured goods because the cost of labor makes overseas manufacturing 
        cheaper and more viable. This has left the gap for farming to be the only sector of production 
        that thrives on the US soil.
        For Kenya, the manufacturing sector is not developed. Kenya imports manufactured goods because 
        the country lacks the technical expertise to manufacture. The Kenyan population grows food to
        feed itself; its is more out of need rather than as a commercial venture.
