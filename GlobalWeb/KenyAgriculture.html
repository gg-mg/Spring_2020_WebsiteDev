                <h2> Government support is vital for farmers success</h2>
                <p>The Kenyan government does not have any policies in place to help her farmers. Farmers are at the
                    mercy of middlemen and brokers.</p>
                <h2>Land Distribution</h2>
                <p>Land distribution is one a major factor which contributes to poor farm output in Kenya. Majority of
                    the people own less than 5 acres of land which can only be suitable for subsitence farming, not 
                    commercial farming. Only a very percentage of arable land, less than 5%, is under commercial
                    farming use.</p>
                <h2>Poor farming techniques</h2>
                <p>Most farmers do not consult agricultural extension officers. This is because the scale of farming
                    does warranty such services. Most farmers depend on rain to grow crops which has become very 
                    unpredictable due to global warming.
                </p>
                <h2>High level corruption</h2>
                <p>It is hard to do anything anywhere in the world, especially commercial farming without involving the
                    goverment. Transparency International, an international NGO which monitors corruption ranked Kenya 137/180 in
                    2019 compared to US which was ranked 12/180 in the same period. Corruption is a hinderance to farming in Kenya
